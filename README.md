# Income-Prediction

A supervised machine learning model that predicts whether the individual salary exceeds a nominal value ( here 50k). Used python libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, and ML library scikit-learn for data preparation and pre-processing. 
Trialed different classifier algorithms and finally deployed the most suited algorithm.
